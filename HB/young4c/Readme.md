 notes:

 The YOUNG*C matrices originally appeared in the Harwell/Boeing     

 collection as type CSA (complex symmetric).  However, both upper   

 and lower triangular parts are present in the original files       

 (an invalid specification; only the lower part can be present      

 in the file).  If the entries in the upper triangular part are     

 considered as part of the matrix, the matrices become unsymmetric. 

 The matrices have been corrected in the UF Sparse Matrix Collection

 by changing their type to CUA so that the entries in the original  

 files are not ignored.  In addition, the YOUNG3C matrix has a zero 

 imaginary part, and thus appears here as a real matrix.
