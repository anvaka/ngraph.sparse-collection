 A Netlib LP problem, in lp/data.  For more information

 The following are relevant excerpts from lp/data/readme (by David M. Gay):    

                                                                               

 The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude      

 slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include         

 the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first          

 right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the            

 MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each       

 line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent        

 mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates       

 whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for "has bounds", R         

 for "has ranges".                                                             

                                                                               

 The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)                   

 running on a VAX with default options.

 The following are relevant excerts from lp/data/minos (by Michael Saunders),  

 regarding experience with MINOS 5.0 on the problems he provided:

 * Objective  is the first row of type N.  It is minimized except as shown.    

                                                                               

 * Itns       is the number of iterations required to solve the problem        

              by the primal simplex method, as implemented in the Fortran      

              code MINOS 5.0 (May 1985), using default values for all          

              parameters.  (The initial basis is triangular.)                  

                                                                               

 * Time       is the processor time required on an IBM 3081K.  The MINOS       

              source code was compiled with the IBM Fortran 77 compiler        

              VS FORTRAN, using the options NOSDUMP, NOSYM and OPT(3).
