(The initial basis is triangular.)                  \n                                                                               \n * Time       is the processor time required on an IBM 3081K.  The MINOS       \n              source code was compiled with the IBM Fortran 77 compiler        \n              VS FORTRAN, using the options NOSDUMP, NOSYM and OPT(3).         \n                                                                               \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"};
