 The lp/infeas directory contains infeasible linear programming test problems

 collected by John W. Chinneck, Carleton Univ, Ontario Canada.  The following

 are relevant excerpts from lp/infeas/readme (by John W. Chinneck):          

                                                                             

 In the following, IIS stands for Irreducible Infeasible Subsystem, a set    

 of constraints which is itself infeasible, but becomes feasible when any    

 one member is removed.  Isolating an IIS from within the larger set of      

 constraints defining the model is one analysis approach.
