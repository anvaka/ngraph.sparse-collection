Isolating an IIS from within the larger set of      \n constraints defining the model is one analysis approach.                    \n                                                                             \n PROBLEM DESCRIPTION                                                         \n -------------------                                                         \n                                                                             \n ITEST6, ITEST2:  very small problems having numerous clustered IISs.        \n These match problems 1 and 2, respectively, in Chinneck and Dravnieks       \n [1991].
