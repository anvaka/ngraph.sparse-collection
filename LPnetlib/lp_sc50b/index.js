We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      \n right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        \n MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   \n line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    \n mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   \n whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for \"has bounds\", R     \n for \"has ranges\".                                                         \n                                                                           \n The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               \n running on a VAX with default options.                                    \n                                                                           \n                        PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE                              \n                                                                           \n Name       Rows   Cols   Nonzeros    Bytes  BR      Optimal Value         \n SC50B        51     48      119       1567       -7.0000000000E+01        \n                                                                           \n Nick Gould supplied SC50A from the Harwell collection of LP test problems.\n When included in Netlib: Cost coefficients negated.                       \n                                                                           \n Added to Netlib on  6 April 1989                                          \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"};
