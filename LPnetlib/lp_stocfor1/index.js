Gay):\n                                                                           \n The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude  \n slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include     \n the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      \n right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        \n MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   \n line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    \n mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   \n whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for \"has bounds\", R     \n for \"has ranges\".                                                         \n                                                                           \n The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               \n running on a VAX with default options.                                    \n                                                                           \n                        PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE                              \n                                                                           \n Name       Rows   Cols   Nonzeros    Bytes  BR      Optimal Value         \n STOCFOR1    118    111      474       4247       -4.1131976219E+04        \n                                                                           \n STOCFOR1,2,3 are stochastic forestry problems from Gus Gassmann.  To      \n quote Gus, \"All of them are seven-period descriptions of a forestry       \n problem with a random occurrence of forest fires, and the size varies     \n according to the number of realizations you use in each period.\"          \n STOCFOR1 \"is the deterministic version, STOCFOR2 has 2 realizations       \n each in periods 2 to 7, and the monster STOCFOR3 has 4,4,4,2,2, and 2     \n realizations, respectively.\"   The compressed form of STOCFOR3 would be   \n 652846 bytes long, so requesting STOCFOR3 will instead get you a bundle   \n of about 174 kilobytes that includes source for Gus's program, the        \n data files for generating STOCFOR3 and a summary of \"A Standard           \n Input Format for Multistage Stochastic Linear Programs\" by J.R. Birge,    \n M.A.H. Dempster, H.I. Gassmann, E.A. Gunn, A.J. King, and S.W. Wallace    \n [COAL Newsletter No. 17 (Dec. 1987), pp. 1-19].  Data files are also      \n included for generating versions of STOCFOR1,2 that have more decimal     \n places than the versions in lp/data.                                      \n                                                                           \n Added to Netlib on  25 June 1988                                          \n                                                                           \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"};
