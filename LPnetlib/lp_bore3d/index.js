We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      \n right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        \n MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   \n line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    \n mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   \n whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for \"has bounds\", R     \n for \"has ranges\".  The BOUND-TYPE TABLE below shows the bound types       \n present in those problems that have bounds.                               \n                                                                           \n The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               \n running on a VAX with default options.                                    \n                                                                           \n                        PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE                              \n                                                                           \n Name       Rows   Cols   Nonzeros    Bytes  BR      Optimal Value         \n BORE3D      234    315     1525      13160  B     1.3730803942E+03        \n                                                                           \n         BOUND-TYPE TABLE                                                  \n BORE3D     UP LO FX                                                       \n                                                                           \n Supplied by Bob Fourer.                                                   \n Source: consulting.                                                       \n Empty RHS section.                                                        \n                                                                           \n When included in Netlib: Extra free rows omitted.                         \n                                                                           \n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------"};
