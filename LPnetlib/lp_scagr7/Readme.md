 A Netlib LP problem, in lp/data.  For more information

 	 send readme from lp/data                                                

                                                                           

 The following are relevant excerpts from lp/data/readme (by David M. Gay):

                                                                           

 The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude  

 slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include     

 the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      

 right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        

 MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   

 line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    

 mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   

 whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for "has bounds", R     

 for "has ranges".                                                         

                                                                           

 The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               

 running on a VAX with default options.

 Bob Bixby reports that the CPLEX solver (running on a Sparc station)      

 finds slightly different optimal values for some of the problems.         

 On a MIPS processor, MINOS version 5.3 (with crash and scaling of         

 December 1989) also finds different optimal values for some of the        

 problems.  The following table shows the values that differ from those    

 shown above.  (Whether CPLEX finds different values on the recently       

 added problems remains to be seen.)
