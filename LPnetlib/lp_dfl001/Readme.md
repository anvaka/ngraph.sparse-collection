 The following are relevant excerpts from lp/data/readme (by David M. Gay):

                                                                           

 The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude  

 slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include     

 the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      

 right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        

 MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   

 line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    

 mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   

 whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for "has bounds", R     

 for "has ranges".  The BOUND-TYPE TABLE below shows the bound types       

 present in those problems that have bounds.

 Submitted by Marc Meketon.                                                

                                                                           

 DFL001, says Marc Meketon, "is a 'real-world' airline schedule planning   

 (fleet assignment) problem.  This LP was preprocessed by a modified       

 version of the KORBX(r) System preprocessor.  The problem reduced in      

 size (rows, columns, non-zeros) significantly.  The row and columns were  

 randomly sorted and renamed, and a fixed adjustment to the objective      

 function was eliminated.  The name of the problem is derived from the     

 initials of the person who created it."                                   

                                                                           

 Bob Bixby reports that the CPLEX solver (running on a Sparc station)      

 finds slightly different optimal values for some of the problems.         

 On a MIPS processor, MINOS version 5.3 (with crash and scaling of         

 December 1989) also finds different optimal values for some of the        

 problems.  The following table shows the values that differ from those    

 shown above.  (Whether CPLEX finds different values on the recently       

 added problems remains to be seen.)

 DFL001       1.1266396047E+07            **                               

                                                                           

 David Gay reports:                                                        

 ** On an IEEE-arithmetic machine (an SGI 4D/380S), I (dmg) succeeded in   

 getting MINOS 5.3 to report optimal objective values, 1.1261702419E+07    

 and 1.1249281428E+07, for DFL001 only by starting with LOAD files         

 derived from the solution obtained on the same machine by Bob             

 Vanderbei's ALPO (an interior-point code); starting from one of the       

 resulting "optimal" bases, MINOS ran 23914 iterations on a VAX before     

 reporting an optimal value of 1.1253287141E+07.  When started from the    

 same LOAD file used on the SGI machine, MINOS on the VAX reported an      

 optimal value of 1.1255107696E+07.  Changing the FEASIBILITY TOLERANCE    

 to 1.E-10 (from its default of 1.E-6) led MINOS on the SGI machine to     

 report "optimal" values of 1.1266408461E+07 and 1.1266402835E+07.  This   

 clearly is a problem where the FEASIBILITY TOLERANCE, initial basis, and  

 floating-point arithmetic strongly affect the "optimal" solution that     

 MINOS reports.  On the SGI machine, ALPO with SPLIT 3 found               

  primal:  obj value =  1.126639607e+07      FEASIBLE   ( 2.79e-09 )       

  dual:    obj value =  1.126639604e+07      FEASIBLE   ( 1.39e-16 )       

                                                                           

 Bob Bixby reports the following about his experience solving DFL001       

 with CPLEX:                                                               

   First, the value for the objective function that I get running          

   defaults is 1.1266396047e+07, with the following residuals:             

                                                                           

   Max. unscaled (scaled) bound        infeas.: 4.61853e-14 (2.30926e-14)  

   Max. unscaled (scaled) reduced-cost infeas.: 6.40748e-08 (6.40748e-08)  

   Max. unscaled (scaled) Ax-b          resid.: 4.28546e-14 (4.28546e-14)  

   Max. unscaled (scaled) c_B-B'pi      resid.: 8.00937e-08 (8.00937e-08)  

                                                                           

   The L_infinity condition number of the (scaled) optimal basis is        

   213737.  I got exactly the same objective value solving the problem in  

   several different ways.  I played a bit trying to get a better          

   reduced-cost infeasibility, but that seems hopeless (if not pointless)  

   given the c-Bpi residuals.                                              

                                                                           

   Just as an aside, this problem exhibits very interesting behavior when  

   solved using a simplex method.  I ran reduced-cost pricing on it in     

   phase I, with the result that it took 465810 iterations to get          

   feasible.  Running the default CPLEX pricing scheme, the entire         

   problem solved in 94337 iterations (33059 in phase I) on a              

   Sparcstation.  Steepest-edge pricing (and a different scaling) took     

   25803 iterations.  This is a nasty problem.
