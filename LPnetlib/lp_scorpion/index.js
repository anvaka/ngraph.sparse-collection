Gay):\n                                                                           \n The column and nonzero counts in the PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE below exclude  \n slack and surplus columns and the right-hand side vector, but include     \n the cost row.  We have omitted other free rows and all but the first      \n right-hand side vector, as noted below.  The byte count is for the        \n MPS compressed file; it includes a newline character at the end of each   \n line.  These files start with a blank initial line intended to prevent    \n mail programs from discarding any of the data.  The BR column indicates   \n whether a problem has bounds or ranges:  B stands for \"has bounds\", R     \n for \"has ranges\".                                                         \n                                                                           \n The optimal value is from MINOS version 5.3 (of Sept. 1988)               \n running on a VAX with default options.                                    \n                                                                           \n                        PROBLEM SUMMARY TABLE                              \n                                                                           \n Name       Rows   Cols   Nonzeros    Bytes  BR      Optimal Value         \n SCORPION    389    358     1708      12186        1.8781248227E+03        \n                                                                           \n Supplied by Bob Fourer.                                                   \n When included in Netlib: Extra free rows omitted.                         \n                                                                           \n Source: J.K.
